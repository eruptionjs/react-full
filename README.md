# Attention

This project is in development and is not considered stable for prod yet. Why: Because we're testing Bun on our workflow. (and we want to be sure what will be our workflow on colocations in order to be prod ready to small and medium project sizes.

# Disclaimer

EruptionJS is not sponsored in any way. It's made with the free time and sweat from RL friends that happens to be developers. We do it when we can and that's why it's slow on development.

We try to be updated on dependencies and security releases, but we do take the time to deliver something with quality that we think it should have (that means: awesome Developer day to day eXperience). 

For most of us, the company does not provide any kind of support in work days to contribute to open source. So please: be patient.
