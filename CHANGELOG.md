- The dependency "@vitest/coverage-c8" was moved to "@vitest/coverage-v8", but without breaking changes.

- Increased rules for a better approach with commintlint usage.
- Increased eslint rules to ensure some good practices. (still a working in progress)

### To the future

- A better and greater eslint ruleset- We aim to have a great DX, but also a great code quality, and that means a more incisive and codebase quality control over time.
- As we learn how to deal with postcss on mantine 7, those learns will also reflect here, not only for css-in-js cases.
- We still need to add a better support for msw, but we are still learning how to use it properly.
- Also we need to add a better support for testing, it's still a pain to work with it in general.
- Our goal to have an opinionated and full swiss army knife version of Eruption ready to use, is still a work in progress. We don't have ATM the time to work on it, but we will get there eventually.

## Know issue

1. on vitest/globals conflicting with testing-lib/jest-dom when running for build/preview scripts. Solutions provided were not sufficient to keep both globals working properly. As a fix, `"skipLibCheck": true,` from `tsconfig.json` was changed to `false`, in order to keep running those scripts.
